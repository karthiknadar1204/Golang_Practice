// We use structs in Go to represent structured data. It's often convenient to group different
//  types of variables together. For example, if we want to represent a car we could do the following:

type car struct {
	make    string
	model   string
	doors   int
	mileage int
}

// This creates a new struct type called car. All cars have a make, model, doors and mileage.
